# Basic features list

- will automatically make a thread in career-questions
- will automatically check if a user has submitted a png or jpg in resume-review and make a thread for them
    - If they don't do either, their message will be deleted and they'll be dm'd a message reminding them to post their resume as an image. I can add pdf to the list of allowed file formats too if needed
- if a user leaves the server, check share-your-content to see if they've sent a message in there, and delete it

## Getting started
To start the bot, you'll need to add a token to a keystore.txt file stored at `/src/main/resources/keystore.txt
target/classes/keystore.txt`. After that, just run Driver.java and everything should work fine!
